        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This Thai yellow curry recipe is a classic chicken curry dish you'll want to make again and again. Here it's made in a traditional way using chicken pieces and potatoes. Adding the taste of tomato is a twist; we've just found it adds that extra bit of flavor that would be missing otherwise.</p>
        <p>The curry sauce is made completely from scratch - no curry paste or powder involved! But it's still very easy to make. Use your food processor or blender, and you can have this curry whipped up and in the oven in just 20 minutes. Then let it bake for an hour while you get on with other things. So easy, so delicious!</p>

            <li>1/2 tsp. chili powder (North American type at your local supermarket spice aisle)</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp. turmeric</li>
            <li>1 tsp. coriander (ground)</li>
            <li>1 tsp. cumin (ground)</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp. cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/3 tsp. white pepper</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp. shrimp paste</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. fish sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. lime juice</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. palm sugar (or brown sugar)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. ketchup</li>
            <li>3/4 can coconut milk (reserve remaining 1/4 can)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps to Make It:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 F.</li>
            <li>Place all curry sauce ingredients in a food processor, large chopper, or blender. Process well to create a fragrant yellow curry sauce.</li>
            <li>Transfer curry sauce to a large casserole-type dish (you will need a lid or foil). Add the chicken stock, and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken pieces and potatoes, reserving the tomatoes for later. Stir everything together. Cover and bake at 375 F for 45 minutes. Remove from over, add tomatoes, cover, and return to oven for 15 to 20 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from over, and check the chicken. If the meat is tender and juices run clear, the dish is cooked. If not, stir and return to oven for another 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Before serving, stir in the reserved coconut milk. Now taste test the curry, adding more fish sauce instead of salt as needed. If the curry is too salty, add a little more lime juice. More chili can be added for more spice. If too spicy, add more coconut milk or chicken stock.</li>
            <li>Top with a handful of lightly chopped coriander, serve with Thai jasmine rice. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
